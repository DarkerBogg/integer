# Integer
Integer is a personal project I'm working on. It started in Python and got moved to C# on September 06, 2021.
<br><br>

## Why?
I started this project to better manipulate files (read from and write to).<br>
Also, while I'm here, I can get more used to Git and GitHub.

## Useful?
The experience gained - yes. The program itself - absolutely not.
<br>
Also, Integer is hard to get along with.
